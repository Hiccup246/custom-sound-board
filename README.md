## ðŸ““ Description

This project represents a custom sound board allowing mp3 files to be displayed
and played within a browser.

The project itself is built using the <b> [Fre$h](https://fresh.deno.dev/)</b>
framework which is yet another modern javascript framework built upon <b>
[Deno](https://deno.com/deploy)</b> (an alternative to
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

<br>

### How to add mp3 files

The mp3 files which will be rendered on the sound board are found within the
`static/sound-clips` directory. The approach taken by this project is a "What
you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) in that:

- Sound clips can be added to the root of this directory or can be organized
  into further directories to aid in sound clip management.
- The name of the mp3 file is the name that will be rendered on the sound board.

### Understanding the project structure

This project is built using <b> [Fre$h](https://fresh.deno.dev/)</b> and follows
its island architecture. This means that heavily interactive components are
located within the `islands` directory and largely static components are found
within the `components` directory.

The project can be understood on a high-level perspective from the "top" down
which begins with the projects' routes:

- `routes/_app.tsx` - Constructs the projects layout, styles the page body

- `routes/index.tsx` - Renders the main page by composing the `SoundBoard` and
  `SoundBoardButton` islands. Processes the `static/sound-clips` directory and
  passes the results to the `SoundBoard` island.

As described the routes then render the core islands and components which make
up the sound board.

- `islands/SoundBoard.tsx` - Renders the search bar and sets the layout for its
  multiple SoundBoardButtons

- `islands/SoundBoardButton.tsx` - Takes a name and src for a sound clip and
  renders a button which when clicked uses [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) to
  play the sound clip.

- `components/HeadElement.tsx` - Renders the main `<Head>` tag of the site and
  contains all information related to SEO and site metadata.

## Usage

To use this project first clone this repository onto your local machine. After
cloning the repository you can then navigate to the root of the project and run
the following command.

```
deno task start
```

This will begin a development server, watch the project directory and restart as
necessary.
